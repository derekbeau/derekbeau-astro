# Derek Beau's Personal Site

A personal site built with [Astro](https://astro.build) where I share my projects, interests, and ideas. This site serves as both a blog and portfolio, documenting my journey in:

- Marketing and code integration
- Web and mobile development with React
- Marketing technology and automation
- AI tools exploration
- Blockchain and web3 development
- Indie hacking and solopreneurship insights

Based in Austin, TX, I combine over two decades of paid traffic experience with three decades of programming to solve interesting problems at the intersection of technology and business.
